# Visual Analysis of Global Health Trends: BMI, Diabetes, and Blood Pressure

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing global health trends related to **Body Mass Index (BMI)**, **Diabetes Prevalence**, and **Raised Blood Pressure** across different countries, years, and genders. The dataset used is the **NCD_RisC dataset**, which provides a multidimensional view of these health metrics from 1975 to 2016. The analysis was conducted using **Tableau** to create interactive visualizations that uncover patterns and relationships in the data.

This project was completed as part of my **Data Science degree** and demonstrates my ability to:
- Clean, explore, and analyze multidimensional datasets.
- Create insightful visualizations using Tableau.
- Derive actionable insights from complex data.
- Communicate findings effectively through dashboards and reports.

## Dataset Details
### Dataset Type
- **Multidimensional dataset** based on three keys: **Countries**, **Year**, and **Sex**.

### Data Types
- **Items**: Countries, Year, Sex.
- **Attributes**: Prevalence of BMI, Raised Blood Pressure, and Age-Standardized Diabetes.

### Attribute Types
- **Categorical**: Countries, Sex.
- **Ordinal Ordered**: Year.
- **Quantitative Ordered**: Prevalence of BMI, Raised Blood Pressure, and Diabetes.

## Analysis Goals
The project was divided into two main tasks:
1. **Single-Measurement Pattern Analysis**:
   - Analyze trends in **BMI prevalence** over time and across regions.
   - Compare differences in obesity rates between genders.

2. **Multi-Measurement Pattern Analysis**:
   - Explore relationships between **BMI**, **Diabetes Prevalence**, and **Raised Blood Pressure** over time and across regions.

## Key Findings
### Task 1: Single-Measurement Analysis (BMI Trends)
1. **Gender-Based Obesity Trends**:
   - From 1975 to 2016, the prevalence of obesity (BMI â‰¥ 30) increased significantly for both genders:
     - **Women**: Increased from 19.46% to 49.76% (2.5x increase).
     - **Men**: Increased from 9.08% to 35.33% (3.9x increase).
   - Women consistently had higher obesity rates than men, but the rate of increase was faster for men.

2. **Regional Obesity Trends**:
   - **Highest Obesity Rates**: Pacific Island nations (e.g., Nauru, Cook Islands) and Middle Eastern countries.
   - **Lowest Obesity Rates**: Countries in South, East, and Southeast Asia, and Africa.
   - The USA, while highly ranked, was not the highest in obesity prevalence.

3. **Visualizations**:
   - **Pie Chart**: Showed the proportion of obesity prevalence between genders.
   - **Line Chart**: Illustrated the growth of obesity rates over time.
   - **World Map**: Highlighted regions with the highest and lowest obesity rates.
   - **Box Plot**: Compared obesity rates between genders with greater accuracy.

### Task 2: Multi-Measurement Analysis (BMI, Diabetes, Blood Pressure)
1. **Relationship Between Obesity and Diabetes**:
   - A **positive correlation** was observed between obesity and diabetes prevalence over time.

2. **Relationship Between Obesity and Raised Blood Pressure**:
   - A **negative correlation** was observed between obesity and raised blood pressure, with some exceptions (e.g., Afghanistan and Ethiopia showed increasing trends in both).

3. **Outliers**:
   - **Qatar** and **Kuwait** had unusually high raised blood pressure levels despite moderate obesity rates.

4. **Visualizations**:
   - **Line Graph**: Showed trends in BMI, diabetes, and blood pressure over time.
   - **Whisker Plot**: Identified outliers in raised blood pressure and diabetes prevalence.

## Tools and Techniques
- **Tableau**: Used for creating interactive dashboards, visualizations, and filtering data by year, region, and gender.
- **Data Cleaning and Preparation**: Handled missing values, ensured data consistency, and transformed data for analysis.
- **Visual Encoding**:
  - **Channels**: Color, size, position (horizontal and vertical).
  - **Marks**: Points, lines, shapes, and areas.
- **Dashboard Features**: Filters for year range and gender, enabling dynamic exploration of the data.

## Why This Project Matters
This project demonstrates my ability to:
- **Analyze Complex Data**: Work with multidimensional datasets to uncover trends and relationships.
- **Visualize Insights Effectively**: Use Tableau to create clear, impactful visualizations.
- **Communicate Findings**: Present insights in a way that is accessible to both technical and non-technical audiences.
- **Think Critically**: Challenge assumptions (e.g., the USA being the most obese country) and validate findings through data.

## How to Use This Repository
1. **Tableau Workbook**: The packaged Tableau workbook (`NCD_RisC_Analysis.twbx`) contains all visualizations and dashboards.
2. **Report**: The detailed report (`Project_Report.docx`) provides a comprehensive explanation of the analysis, findings, and visualizations.
3. **Presentation**: A 5-minute presentation (`Project_Presentation.pptx`) summarizes the key insights and methodology.
